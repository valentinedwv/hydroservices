Description:
    Utilize Geoserver and other OpenGeo tools as a platform for exposing geographic information via services,
    and the services are registered as available formats/access points in the resources
    * geotiff  - WCS and WMS
    * shapefiles - WFS/WMS
    * excel/csv - WFS/WMS
    * NetCDF -WCS/WMS
    Use the HS data to populate the services description. eg title, creator, etc
    Develop a set of tasks for the celery task queue so that when resources are registered they are created as
    data sources/layers

    In the initial prototype, files can be pushed to geoserver. In the future, irods should be mounted.

    Initially, resources will be registered as individual resources. Plans on how to group resources into layers,
    eg resources for a project, like shapefiles and monitoring sites from a group of resources.



Initial steps:
  * show that we can populate geoserver with file type X using the geoserver API
    * collect a sample of data from hydroshare
  * write tasks to implement file type X
    * create
    * update
    * delete
  * modify resource to create a task to publish a resource to geoserver

Decisions:
    Workspaces are a concept in geoserver. Workspace have data stores (vectors, images, etc)
    Should workspaces be resources, by data type, or by group/projects

    Individual resources
        initially these will be Individual resources.

    Future:
        load a set of zipped files, eg the NFIE data as a project

    Task naming:
